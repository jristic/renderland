* Clean up parsing -> pass BufferIter by reference
* Use switch statement for PeekNextToken.
* Allow declaring RLF structures inline as well as by reference. 
* Specify shader parameters in the RLF and allow tuning via the imgui display.
* Proper error reporting mechanism for RLF (rather than asserts).
	* Count newlines and characters to indicate line and char where it happened. 
* Allow specifying buffers/textures in RLF.
	* Declaration for buffers and textures -> format, usage, etc.
	* Speicfy input and output resources for dispatches
	* Special value texture for backbuffer?
* Replace std::string usage with own implementation. 
* Integrate RenderDoc capture?
* Expand to the draw pipeline.
* Investigate automatically reloading any time a file is updated.
