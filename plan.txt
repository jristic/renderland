* Expose D3D debug errors to the user. 
	* Report D3D errors in object creation. 

* Allow trailing commas in rlf arrays. 
* Hex uint literals. binary too?
* Comments support in RLF. 

* Use linear memory allocator for RenderDescription allocations. 
* Defines that are usable within the RLF and shader. 
* Allow #include of other RLF files
* Better way to size structured buffers.
	* right now you have to figure out manually how big a struct would be and enter that as the ElementSize field.
	* Perhaps I can parse the types in the shader and compute their sizes, then have something in RLF like "sizeof(shader, type)".
* Templating of blocks of RLF data
	* For instance if you wanted to draw a model multiple times, you have all the boilerplate for a draw, but you allow the position / obj-file / textures to be substituted. 
	* Kind of like a text prefab.
* Integrate RenderDoc capture?
* Investigate automatically reloading any time a file is updated.
* Dynamic flow control? 
	* Some way to only run a pass on the first frame, for instance. 
	* Some way to choose which shader to run based on some condition. 

* Constant buffers and constant filling
	* Tuneables: Specify shader parameters in the RLF and allow tuning via the imgui display.
		* Support vector tuneables, including with the color editor. 
	* future: Expand to allow declaring vars like floats, ints, vectors, matrices in RLF, reference them for SetConstants

**** Expand draw pipeline support.
	* Render to texture
		* need some way to size rendertarget based on backbuffer
	* Access depth/stencil through SRV
		* Typeless format on a resource with a SRV that has a typed format.  
	* Viewport.
	* Blend state.
	* Multiple RT support. 
	* Instancing for draws.
	* Indirect dispatch and draws.
		* will need to implment append and consume buffers as well.
	* Multiple vertex buffer support. 
	* MSAA support.

* Sample: Shadow volumes.
* Sample: Compute-generated vertex buffer for a draw
* Sample: Shadow-sampling methods comparison. 
* Sample: Clustered lighting.
* Sample: Compute-based culling with draw-indirect.
* Sample: Mirror reflection. 
* Sample: Compute fluid simulation. 
* Sample: Compute sorted triangles for transparency rendering. 
* Sample: Deferred rendering with gbuffers.
