* Allow specifying buffers/textures in RLF.
	* Declaration for buffers and textures -> format, usage, etc.
	* Specify input and output resources for dispatches
	* Special value texture for backbuffer?
* Allow underscore in identifiers.
* Add a SimpleTexture sample. 
* Specify shader parameters in the RLF and allow tuning via the imgui display.
	* Should I fill a constant buffer declared in the shader using reflection info? or generate a global / per-dispatch constant buffer for shaders?
* Allow populating texture from file (DDS).
* Defines that are usable within the RLF and shader. 
* Implement the include handler for shader compilation. 
* Use linear memory allocator for RenderDescription allocations. 
* Allow #include of other RLF files
* Better way to size structured buffers.
	* right now you have to figure out manually how big a struct would be and enter that as the ElementSize field.
* Integrate RenderDoc capture?
* Expand to the draw pipeline.
* Investigate automatically reloading any time a file is updated.
